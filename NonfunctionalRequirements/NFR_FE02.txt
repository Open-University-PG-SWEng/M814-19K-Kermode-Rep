Type: Performance Requirements â€“ Type 12

Fit Criterion: 70% of the invoices should be transmitted to the insurance with less than two actions taken by the receptionist. 
Originator: Receptionist

Comment: [FE] This is my test comment
[CJ]: Can this be 100%? i.e. it should be possible to transmit all invoices with less than two actions? Less than 2 is the same as saying 1 action, so it's worth being more specific and changing it to either 1, or less than or equal to 2.
