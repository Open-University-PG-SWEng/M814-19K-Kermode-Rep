REQ-ID: KF01-N01
Description: The system shall allow a patient to book an appointment based on their desired treatment.
Type: 11 - Usability
Rationale: So that new and existing patients are able to select a therapist for their required treatment.
Fit Criterion: Ninety five percent of bookings made are with an appropriate therapist.
Originator: Office Manager (Carol)
Comments: [APM] Fit criterion “agreed” by Office Manager as if a patient books with an incorrect therapist it can mean a wait for a new appointment with the correct therapist.  Errors will result in therapists not having the patient booked to see them and therefore lost revenue.
[TMM] I am unclear of what an appropriate therapist means, shouldn't 100% of appointments be made with an appropriate therapist? You could state that the system should easily be able to see which type of an appointment they are booking. I don't think this should pass the quality gateway.
[MB] I took "appropriate therapist" to mean a therapist qualified to treat the patient's condition. So it might be clearer to change the description to something like - The system shall allow a user to book an appointment based on their desired treatment". I think for the rationale it is more likely that new patients would require this than existing patients as existing patients are more likely to want to see the therapist they have seen previously.
Comment: [FE] The rationale is not clear to me. I think the receptionist or someone from the office should select the appropriate therapist and not the patient itself.
