REQ-ID: KF01-N01
Description: The system shall allow users to select a therapist easily without knowledge of a name.
Type: 11 - Usability
Rationale: So that new and existing patients are able to select an appropriate therapist for their required treatment.
Fit Criterion: Ninety five percent of bookings made are with an appropriate therapist.
Originator: Office Manager (Carol)
Comments: [APM] Fit criterion “agreed” by Office Manager as if a patient books with an incorrect therapist it can mean a wait for a new appointment with the correct therapist.  Errors will result in therapists not having the patient booked to see them and therefore lost revenue.
