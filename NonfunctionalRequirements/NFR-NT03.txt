REQ-ID: NT03
Description: The product should ensure only office staff should have access to patients personal details
Type: 15
Rationale: It may be that therapists are to use the system in the future, but they dont need personal details on a patient to record treatment details
Fit Criterion: Of 1000 instances of access to patients details, none shall be from an account other than those of the office staff. 
Originator: Office Manager, Carol
Comments:
[JS] Some of the data may need to be accesed - i.e. patient name, or last appointment date etc - so I think that "personal details" needs to be quantified and the access made more explicit. Also I don't feel that the "1000 instances" really makes the criterion any more measurable - perhaps it would be better worded as something like: "[some user role] shall not be able to access patient data that is marked as restricted as specified in the data dictionary. [some other user role] shall have unrestricted access." Clearly the data dictionary would need to be populated and referenced and the necessary user roles defined.
