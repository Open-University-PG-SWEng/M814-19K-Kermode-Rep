REQ-ID: MB06-CJ01
Description: The product shall ensure that only authorised users have access to book appointments
Type: Security Requirements (Type 15)
Rationale: It is important to ensure the accuracy of booked appointments as these will be used to plan sessions and used to work out which appointments have been missed.
Fit Criterion: Users must be authorised and logged into the system with a password to book an appointment. If a user is not authorised and/or not logged in they cannot book an appointment. Access shall be restricted to specific users who need to book appointments (e.g. receptionists).
An authorised user can book an appointment if logged into the system, but cannot book an appointment if not logged in. Additionally, other unauthorised users cannot book appointments.
Originator: Ceri-anne Jackson
Comments: [KF] I would like to suggest that "Only authorized and logged in users can book appointments" is easier to understand.
Comments: [YK] I suggest to rewrite the Fit Criterion to be more precise as following: Only authorised users, with 'therapist' or 'receptionist' roles, can book an appointment.
Comments: [JM]  Generally I think this is a good NFR.  It appears to be atomic, uses consistent language and the fit criteria is a measurable binary.  The only thing that might be worthwhile considering is tightening up the wording around “authorised user”.  Can everyone who is logged into the system book an appointment?  Does being “logged in” apply to clinic staff or members of the pubic (or both)?  Is there a specific user group of logged on users that permits them to book appointments? 
Comments: [APM]  I agree that saying "authorised user" could be more specific, but limiting to certain roles (as suggested by YK) may be restricting as if it is decided that other roles e.g. the office manager, might be able to book appointments if would involve a change to the system.
