REQ-ID: MB06-CJ01
Description: The product shall ensure that only authorised users have access to book appointments
Type: Security Requirements (Type 15)
Rationale: It is important to ensure the accuracy of booked appointments as these will be used to plan sessions and used to work out which appointments have been missed.
Fit Criterion: An authorised user can book an appointment if logged into the system, but cannot book an appointment if not logged in. Additionally, other unauthorised users cannot book appointments.
Originator: Ceri-anne Jackson
Comments: [KF] I would like to suggest that "Only authorized and logged in users can book appointments" is easier to understand.
