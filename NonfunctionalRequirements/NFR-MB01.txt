        REQ-ID: NFRMB01
   Description: The system shall return a list of potential appointments within a timely manner.
          Type: Performance (12)
     Rationale: For the receptionist to work efficiently and not hold up patients, the system will need to 	
                return available appointments quickly.
 Fit Criterion: The system will need to return a list of available appointments within 3 seconds for 95% of requests and within 5 seconds for the remaining 5% of requests.
    Originator: Office Manager (Carol)
      Comments: [JB] Would it be more realistic to categorise the response times; for example, 3 seconds 95% leaving 5% within 6 seconds; 5 seconds does seem quite a long time for all queries.
