Comments		: [M814-ModuleChair] Add comments below, making sure to include your initials in [] at the start.
Comments		: [APM] I would suggest that "1000 times" is incorrect and should "100% of the time".  It is suggesting that once it has provided the correct information 1000 times, it is OK to provide wrong information.
Comments		: [MB] I agree the fit criteria should not stipulate a number of times and would be better expressed as a percentage as APM has suggested.
