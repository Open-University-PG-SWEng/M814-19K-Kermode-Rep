Comment         : [CJ] I'm not sure the second half of the fit criterion is needed. 95% within 3 seconds sounds reasonable, but committing to 100% within 5 seconds may be unrealistic given there is bound to be some down-time or connectivity issues at some point.
Comment         : [TMM] I am in agreement with the first half, although I would probably drop it to 90% of the time.
Comment         : [JB] The fit criterion needs to be testable, requiring a quantifiable approach. The current fit criterion is acceptable in my view and needed to pass the quality gateway.
