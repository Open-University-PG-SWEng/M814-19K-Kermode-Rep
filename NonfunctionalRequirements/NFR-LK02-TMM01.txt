         [JS] Well done as this is often overlooked. As there are potentially many disabilities to cover that would need to be addressed in different ways, it might be better if the fit criterion referenced some accessibility standard - i.e. something like "The product shall conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1, June 05 2018 (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)" There may well be a UK specific standard that could be referenced.
         [LK] In your fit criterion you could state that payment is recorded using computer, because there could be some other kind of standalone terminals which don't require peripherals such as mouse. It's something small, but maybe worth mentioning?
	     [NT] I think the fit criterion, while does mention alternative inputs, doesnt cover everything and could be seen as an inclusive list. It may be better written something like "The user should be able to interact fully with the system when using the most commonly used assistive technologies"
         [CJ] I think this is good to pass the quality gateway, I'd maybe just remove "the ability to" as that sounds a little ambiguous. Maybe "without the need of a mouse and using a screen reader".
