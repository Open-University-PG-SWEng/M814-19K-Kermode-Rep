REQ-ID: NFR-JM01 

Description: The system shall produce a report identifying missed appointments which were not previously cancelled within 3 seconds 

Type: 12 (Performance Requirement) 

Rationale: Clinic staff need the ability to identify those clients who have missed appointments without first cancelling, together with details of the appointment, so that an appropriate invoice can be issued to the client thereby ensuring the clinic does not incur a loss in revenue due to missed appointments.  It will also serve to identify repeat offenders with a view to removing them from the Clinicâ€™s business list. 

Fit Criterion: The system shall produce 98% of reports detailing the missed appointments which were not previously cancelled within 3 seconds of the report being requested by an authorised user 

Originator: Neil (Blossom Hill Clinic owner)
