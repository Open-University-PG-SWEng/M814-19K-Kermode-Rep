REQ-ID: KF02
Description: The system shall have interfaces which are easy to find and select the pre-set of symptoms.
Type: 11 Usability
Rationale: When recording symptom, it should be written in a fixed format as much as possible and system must have presets of popular symptom to help find symptom, but generally such number of pre-sets are large and takes a long time to find right symptom, therefore the system will need to have user-friendly interfaces which enable the therapist to find symptom easily.
Fit Criterion: The therapist should be able to find a first symptom in less than 30 Sec

Comment: [ZKM] "Proper" font size and color is hard to justify. I think you might want to add metrics such as approval/recognition by X users or something in that direction.
Comment: [APM] I agree that "Proper font size and color" is hard to justify. I think it should refer to agreed design standards that have researched or used previously.
Comment: [FE] I think using a time condition for the fit criterion would be apropirate. Somthing like: the therapist should be able to find a symptom in less than 30 sec. 
comment: [KF] I chose [FE] comment as my fit criterion. I think it is easy to understand and testable criterion.
