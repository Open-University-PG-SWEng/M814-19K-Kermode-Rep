REQ-ID: KF02
Description: The system shall have interfaces which are easy to find and select the preset of symptoms.
Type: 11 Usability
Rationale: When recording symptom, it should be written in a fixed format as much as possible and system must have presets of popular symptom to help find symptom, but generally such number of presets are large and takes a long time to find right symptom, therefore the system will need to have user-friendly interfaces which enable the therapist to find symptom easily.
Fit Criterion: The system will need to display each symptom in alphabetic, 
               and in categorized order with the proper font size and color which conform to google's design guide.
Originator: Office Manager (Carol)

Comment: [ZKM] "Proper" font size and color is hard to justify. I think you might want to add metrics such as approval/recognition by X users or something in that direction.
Comment: [APM] I agree that "Proper font size and color" is hard to justify. I think it should refer to agreed design standards that have researched or used previously.
Comment: [FE] I think using a time condition for the fit criterion would be apropirate. Somthing like: the therapist should be able to find a symptom in less than 30 sec.
